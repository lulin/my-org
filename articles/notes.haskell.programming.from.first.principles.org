* Notes

** Parenthesizing

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There are times when you want to refer to an infix function
without applying any arguments, and there are also times
when you want to use them as prefix operators instead of infix.
In both cases you must wrap the operator in parentheses.

** Partial functions

Notice the difference between *partial application of functions* with the concept *partial function*

#+begin_quote
We’ve mentioned partial application of functions previously,
but the term partial function refers to something different. A
partial function is one that doesn’t handle all the possible cases,
so there are possible scenarios in which we haven’t defined
any way for the code to evaluate.
